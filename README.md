# Initial commit

I will try to perform a python-based console & web service which allow to encrypt and decrypt code to avoid code stealing of all kinds.

I go on the base of a pseudo "two factors authentification" which will encrypt each character of the uploaded code in another character with an apparent randomly generated password but really chosen by the user.

Let's go on the backend !
